## Contributing

Thanks for your interest in improving UNCHAIN!

No contribution is too small and all contributions are valued. Our discord is available for any concerns you may have that are not covered in this brief guide.

If you contribute to this project, your contributions will be made to the project under the MIT license.

### Ways to contribute

There are largely three ways an individual can contribute:

1. **By opening an issue**: For example, if you believe that you have uncovered a bug or vulnerability in this repository, creating a new issue in the issue tracker is the way to report it.
2. **By adding context:** Providing additional context to existing issues, such as screenshots and code snippets to help resolve issues.
3. **By resolving issues:** Typically this is done in the form of either demonstrating that the issue reported is not a problem after all, or more often, by opening a pull request that fixes the underlying problem, in a concrete and reviewable manner.

Anybody can participate in any stage of contribution. We urge you to participate in the discussion around bugs and participate in reviewing PRs.
